__This template includes several files for testing, building, and deploying a Jekyll site via GitHub FTP action to any server.__  

For NYU-DSS, this will generally be to an NYU Web Hosting server, e.g., `specialcollections.hosting.nyu.edu` with CPanel.  
This can be adapted to use any static site generator; you'll just need to change the dependencies installed in actions and replace the rake tasks with your runner of choice.

2. Create a special FTP account just for deployments. Under ‚Äúdirectory‚Äù put public_html. If you want the site to be in a subdirectory from the root URL (e.g., ‚Äúmarii.hosting.nyu.edu/my-site‚Äù), enter the subdirectory after `public_html` with no trailing slash (e.g., `public_html/my-site`). More info available [here](https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/files/ftp-accounts/).
